# stegriff-short-urls

Shortens links at the command line to give me things like <https://url.stegriff.co.uk/FGoFK>

This is mine! You could fork it to make your own though. 

Uses <https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener>

## How to use it

You need to have Node installed

Clone the repo

`npm run shorten <some long link>`

or 

`npm run shorten <some long link> customalias`

## Trouble during setup

Had to push with `git push --set-upstream origin master` to get the remote to track the local?? Whatever that means.

## In Conclusion

This is cool!!
